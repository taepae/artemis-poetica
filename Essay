Short Essay
> 1)	Programming is a structure that precludes human limitations. Understandably, humans invented programming and use such for our comprehension and organization of the world in which we find ourselves. However, the execution of programming and the models, matrices and databases that code builds has no limit.
I tried coding with several of the modules on GitHub, FreeCodeCamp and Ada Academy.  I am more interested in programming with people. Also, I like the structure and satori aspect of “getting in a zone” that coding offers. I am interested in coding ot engage my mind in a deep level and also create something for the world.
> 2)	I do not have a vision for my career in five years. I have often followed the path of least resistance which may or may not serve me well. At times, the path of least resistance is easy on my soul and at other times, brutally honest. Nevertheless, I have had an interesting life. I have middleclass aspirations of supporting myself financially, assisting my child through college and possibly establishing a multi use building with a medical clinic, residences and restaurant. I hope with the dialogue I learn and practice at Ada I can bring the language of inclusivity and social responsibility to this endeavor. 
> 3)	I am a dynamic facilitator. In the past, it has been my tendency to draw in people. I hope to improve this capacity by discussing and problem solving with peers in a fun, intellectually challenging and engaging dynamic. I am at times a jokester, I bring levity to otherwise intense environments. This may be subtly distracting.
> 4)	I made the mistake of trying to do too much the last three years. I am introverted by nature, yet, I challenge myself to engage with people. I think the partner projects at Ada will allow me to engage and also the small cohorts us connect where we might not otherwise go. I will contribute to Ada’s mission and vision by encouraging myself and those around me. I learned that I need to disengage outside of “work” whatever that looks like and focus on my own basic self care. I feel the structure at Ada will help me serve this capacity. After viewing a vlog and the prospective students Q &A on YouTube, I feel encouraged I can work towards a common goal of  programming and problem solving.
